##  Hi, I'm Emmanuella 👋 

🔐 **Pharmacist | Cybersecurity Analyst | IT Analyst**

I’m a Pharmacist with a strong foundation in healthcare systems obtained from 7years of practice, now transitioning into **Cybersecurity** out of passion for IT and desire to protect sensitive patient and customer data. I am deeply interested in **Healthcare IT security**, blending compliance knowledge with technical training. I recently earned the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate (April 2025)** and am currently completing a Cybersecurity Diploma at ABM College (Dec 2025). 

I have garnered knowledge and skills in technical hardware, software and network troubleshooting, network architecture and data analytics, SIEM and IDS/IPS tools, systems configuration, active directory management, Linux administration, scripting and programming with Python and SQL, cybersecurity frameworks including NIST, ISO/IEC 27001 and security standards and regulations such as **HIPAA, PCI-DSS** and **GDPR**. I absolutely enjoy working with technology analyzing and solving complex problems.
